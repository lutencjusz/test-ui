# test-ui

An application based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for testing new React components and hooks, the latest versions of React and its components, testing the most effective libraries and the ones that suit me best, testing relationships between components.

Everything has been tied into a simple, themed structure so you can easily add new components and remove ones that do not work.

The components are in different stages of development, and the progress of the work depends on the current needs.

The priority is to implement functional components and hooks with the latest version of React. Prepared solutions should be easy to implement in future projects and thus not overloaded.

# Basic website structure:

- **Forms** - new and popular libraries for creating forms. The components here should have at least basic and advanced fields that require compliance checking, full compliance checking for forms, submitting results, clearing the form, and inserting default values.

- **Applications** - mini-applications that represent the key dependencies between components and currently required prototypes that solve problems important to customers.

- **Hooks** - testing the latest and most useful hooks based on functional components.

- **Graphs** - testing libraries for graphs and graphing results

- **Graphs** - mini applications present relations between objects in an attractive graphical form. Enables future creation of tools for creating structures and dependencies between objects.
